## Most published research is false

::: incremental
::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Whenever people look at this, things don't look great...[@baker_1500_2016; @ioannidis_why_2005; @smaldino_natural_2016; @head_extent_2015]
-   Citations aren't a good metric of quality either[@yang_estimating_2020]
-   Small sample sizes are a big issue, especially in neuroscience[@button_power_2013]

:::
:::
:::

::: notes
-   Small sample size = low power = less change to detect non-null effects, but *also* more likely that any significant effect found is false
:::

## Academic journals suck

. . .

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
-   Journal status and paper quality are poorly correlated[@szucs_empirical_2017; @brembs_prestigious_2018]
-   Space is dominated by 5 big publication houses - [they are evil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzLgGSNq0Wk)[@racimo_ethical_2022]
-   Strong bias against negative results
-   Do they spend their staggering profits checking for obvious signs of fraud, encourage replication or even just make science more readable and accessible? Of course not.[@buranyi_is_2017]
-   Nice documentary on the business of scholarship [here](https://vimeo.com/273358286)[@noauthor_paywall_2018]

[![](images/stop_elseiver.png)](https://stopelsevier.wordpress.com/)
:::

::: notes
-   High IF journals are super competitive \> they get swamped with too-good-to-be-true data by desperate scientists
-   Obscene profit margins \< 35% VS 2/11/21% for Amazon/Google/Apple
:::

## GUIs suck

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
-   Graphical user interface (GUI) tools like Excel, SPSS & Graphpad are very opaque and error prone, as our government learnt during COVID[@hern_covid_2020]
-   The Excel mistake heard around the world and the lasting economic repercussions[@ryssdal_excel_2013]
-   Propriety software - many people can't access it and therefore can't replicate analysis
-   No obvious history of changes made or operations performed

![](images/excel_goof.gif)
:::

## Stats suck

-   Frequentist statistics is used almost exclusively for all science
    -   It is extremely unintuitive and prone to abuse and is rarely done correctly in practise (p-hacking)[@head_extent_2015]
    -   Great video on why p-values are hella variable[@geoff_cumming_intro_2013]
-   Bayesian statistics is a fundamentally different approach, no ground truth assumptions so no pvalues and no p-hacking

::: notes
-   Link to GUI issue - just click buttons on all test to get sig p-value
:::

### Experimental designs suck

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Positive control? pretty pls?

## An investigator cannot guarantee that the claims made in a study are correct

-   Reproducibility is important not because it ensures that the results are correct, but rather because it ensures transparency and gives us confidence in understanding exactly what was done.

![](images/power_pose.gif){fig-align="center"}

## An example of a wee goof in the field

-   That time a major paper that supposedly discovered A$\beta$*56 a oligermer species, turned out to be full of image manipulations, whoops[@piller_potential_2022]

## Solutions

![](images/we_can_do_better.gif)

## Registered reports

-   Largely solves two of the biggest issues - post-hoc hypothesising/data massaging and inability to publish negative results
-   Make it [diamond open access](https://www.coalition-s.org/diamond-open-access/) and you can stick it to the evil publishers too!
    -   Check out PCI: [https://rr.peercommunityin.org/](https://www.coalition-s.org/diamond-open-access/)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   "But the big IF journals don't do registered reports"
-   Yeah, they're evil remember? Of course they won't do anything to make science not suck
    -   Also, Nature does do them now (they're still evil though)

## An idealised workflow

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
1.  Come up with neat project idea
2.  pre-register study (can be embargoed) and write up registered report
3.  publish registered report \> get valuable feedback from wise and courteous reviewers (let me dream pls)
4.  Apply for funding, pointing to your already peer-reviewed project as evidence of it's strength \> get all the moneys
5.  Do project as you said you would \> get results (everything worked first time)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/imagination.gif)

6.  Publish all the things!
:::
:::

## Let there be code

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Code is just a set of instructions to tell a computer to do something
-   It's an explicit bridge between your raw experimental data (which should be *sacrosanct*!) and your reported stats/figures
-   Great video guide here[@mine_cetinkaya-rundel_improve_2020]
-   Version control: wouldn't it be nice to have a detailed record of all the changes made to all the files in a project when and by whom? Use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and the [DRI GitHub](https://github.com/UKDRI)!
-   Use whatever, as long as it's open-source
-   Containerisation: encapsulate your computational environment[@nust_ten_2020]

## Particualr tool suggestions

-   R or Python for data analysis and use literate programming methods like [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and/or [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)[^2]
-   If you want to do Bayesian but still want a GUI: [JASP](https://jasp-stats.org/)

[^2]: Don't stress over R vs Python, it's doesn't matter. Quarto is my fav for writing/analysis
